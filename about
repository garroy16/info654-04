  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Home: an Experiment, a Dream</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Home: an Experiment, a Dream</strong> is a collection of prose ranging in length, style, and
      genre. Specifically, it charts the experiences of the author (or character of the author) dealing
      with themes of queerness, Latinidad, embodiment, loss, and memory. The images and textual
      pieces that comprise the collection are unified by the question of the “home”. There are moments
      when the narrator: attempts to conjure their childhood self; imagines the home of sus abuelitos;
      begins with the question of what it means to feel at home living in a queer and brown body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through experiments with typography, translations, and visual materials, the work itself attempts
      to reconstruct the spaces and sense of “home” by serving as a kind of container — a collage
      of images, recipes, folklore, and theory. In this sense it takes its inspiration from Ursula K. Le Guin’s
      <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/u/uk/ursula-k-le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</em></a> as well as critical work by writers like Renee Gladman,
      Audre Lorde, Gabriel García Márquez, Toni Morrison, Giada Scodellaro, and Camila Sosa Villada.
    </p>

    <p> The author reconstructs home by building a new reality of language, memory, and embodiment to serve the here and now through experimental prose writing. The container of the
project is “home” as the author alchemizes life as material to work through the messiness of the
everyday in order to make sense of one's home. <em>Home: an Experiment, a Dream</em> demonstrates
the intimate relationship between home, language, and the body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Appropriately, <em>Home: an Experiment, a Dream</em> both names and maps a way of thinking and
      writing queer existence — our truths — while illuminating new modes of queer possibilities to exist
      otherwise in the here and now.
