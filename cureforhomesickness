    <h1>Cure for Homesickness</h1>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>
        I began the day missing home. At twenty-four I moved almost three thousand miles exactly away
        from my childhood home in Los Angeles to New York City. From one beast of a metropolitan
        city to another. Like a spore, a seedling carried by the wind and landing in between the cracks of
        the sidewalk I began laying roots. I walked a new street every day for three hundred and sixty-
        five days and gave each street a meaning (I tried to at least). The first street was in the direction
        of a coffee shop that roasts their beans with cinnamon, another was the location of the subway
        entrance that cut through the middle of Manhattan, the third street had a grocery store that sold
        lemons that almost tasted like the ones from home but were slightly bitter, on another street sat a
        bookstore where the owner let me browse vagrantly through their collection, the fifth street had a
        bagel shop with the fluffiest bagels I’ve ever tasted discovering my new love for cream cheese
        and lox, on a different street there was a vintage store I’d spend time sifting through the racks of
        over-priced second-hand garments I’d never purchase. By the end of the three hundred and sixty-
        five days I had created a new map of home without even realizing
        —restructuring the city’s streets and subways in a shape that fit my new world. I felt my mind
        and body relax, finally finding comfort between the cracks of the sidewalk, yet as I navigated my
        new home there was an unannounced visitor making space within my body; they brought a
        heaviness, a sharp pain, a sadness, and a longing for what was familiar. At nights I lay awake
        unable to put words to my unwelcomed melancholy and it would tuck me in with a blanket of
        grief. I attempted to bury myself in books and writing, a cure that always worked anywhere back
        home in the Los Angeles area, but now failed. I was forgetting: forgetting what brought me joy,
        forgetting what it was like to drive fifteen minutes to a friend’s house, forgetting the smell of
        Mom’s cooking in the kitchen overwhelming our home, forgetting the feel of the warm
        California sun and refreshing ocean breeze, forgetting the sound of my Abuelita’s and Abuelito's laugh,
        forgetting the taste of pozole on Sunday mornings. Before I moved across the country, I made
        sure to pack everything I needed. I included some cherished tokens that remind me of home, one
        of those was a small mason jar of lemon seeds from the Lemon Tree in our backyard. At the
        beginning I didn't know how to cure this homesickness. I swallowed a lemon seed. I swallowed another lemon seed. Sometimes they made me sad because I thought when I ate them, I would be
        destroying pieces of home. I craved for home to be part of me; it wasn’t until I swallowed all the
        lemon seeds that made me realize Home was always intimately interwoven with my body.
